<h2>1.Game-Sankes &amp; Ladders(windows version 7.0 &amp; 7.1)</h2>

<p>This was a small game that i developwd as a hobby in a two weeks time sometime last year when Nokia was
on so called "Burning Platform".
Here is a link to the game that you try it out, its not a very great app but you can play it. images on request.

<h2>2.Expense tracker.</h2>

<h3>Expense Tracker, this is a small private project shared among small set of peopel who use this app to update the Expenses on the go.</h3>

<p>This was ideated by my husband(Ashish Sharma, Co-Founder of minkel.in, stalkninja.com, codelearn.org)
There was a way which we found not so intutative to update on the go was to login into docs.google.com and update the expenses,this becomes really difficult if you have a lot of sheets and files, so the idea to create a app which would update into correct sheet was born.</p>

<p>during the development of this app, i got to learn the usage of childbrowser.js and oAuth(used to know the authnecity of the user.)</p>

<p>[soon to upload the screen shots of the app]</p>

<h1>Freelance Project</h1>

<h2>1.Mobile version of Reviewgist.com</h2>

<p>This is a simple phonegap app(android version) which uses simple JQuery, AJAX request to get the data from the 
Reviewgist.com and populate the app.
Get the Review of any product in just four clicks :) as said by Nishant Soni(CEO of Reviewgist.com).

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yv4xut5yy6v6yfl/Bjb2NH25kE">Screen shots</a></p>

<p>I have used certain js files to improve the performance of the app:
1. Fastclick.js to get the faster response for the user clicks(touches).</p>
